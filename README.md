# Homework Hero

Homework Hero is a React app built with Vite, designed to help students (like my daughter) keep track of homework assignments, especially paper handouts that often get forgotten. This app aims to bridge the gap between physical homework and digital reminders by providing a simple, user-friendly platform to manage, organize, and remember homework tasks.
